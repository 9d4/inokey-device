# inokey-device

THIS PROJECT IS PART OF [THIS ONE](https://gihtub.com/9d4/inokey-daemon), CONSIDER VISITING THAT ONE FIRST.

Arduino will write certain byte to serial, the [daemon](https://gihtub.com/9d4/inokey-daemon) will catch it.

To upload code to Arduino, you may need to install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org), or just use ArduinoIDE and copy the code.
You can customize it as needed.
